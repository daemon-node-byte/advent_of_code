# adventOfCode 2020

## Day 1

### Part 1

this one is pretty straight forward. the goal is find two numbers that total 2020, and return the product of the two numbers that sum 2020 from the provided input for part one I simple used two for loops to find the numbers that summed 2020 and return the product of those two numbers

### Part 2

same thing, self explanitory, but this time we are looking for 3 numbers that sum 2020,  then return the product of those 3 numbers
